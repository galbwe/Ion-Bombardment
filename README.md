# ion-bombardment
Code from my master's project meant to numerically approximate the solutions of a coupled system of partial differential equations which model the response of a binary solid to ion bombardment at normal incidence. This code is specific to one system, namely the Bradley-Shipman equations after they have been modified to incorporate the effects of phase separation, but can be modified to solve other stiff systems of PDE's.
